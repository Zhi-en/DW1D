NOTICE: For all repository contributors. Before you git push, please ensure you follow the conventions below.

    CODING CONVENTIONS:
        Class names are to have capital first letter. e.g. 'class Account'
        Functions use an underscore to separate the words in the name. e.g. 'def hot_potato(a, b, c)' (or you can use camel case if you really want)
        Variables names are in camel case. e.g. 'coffeeCup = 0' (or you can use underscore if you really want)
        Include the following line at the top of every python file: '#!/usr/bin/env python'. This ensures that the file can be executed from bash easily.
        All imports are to be done at the top of the python file.
        Try to modularise your code as much as possible. i.e. put them into smaller functions instead of writing them in a gigantic code block
        
    SAMPLE PYTHON FILE:
        #!/usr/bin/env python

        import numpy
        import sys

        def clean_and_exit():
            print "Cleaning..."
            GPIO.cleanup()
            print "Bye!"
            sys.exit()

        def foo(a,s,d,f):
            return a + s + d + f

        def bar():
            print 'potato' * 100
        
        def setup():
            global a = 1
            global s = 2
            global d = 3
            global f = 4

        def main():
            print foo(a, s, d, f)
            bar()
        
        setup() #run the setup code
        
        try:
            main() #run the main code
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            clean_and_exit()
    

GIT/GITHUB QUICK GUIDE:
    Initial Setup:
        Navigate to the location you want to store a local copy of the git repository files using the cd command (go check google)
        git clone <git clone URL>

    To upload to your branch, please git checkout <your branch> first.
        1) git add .
        2) git commit
            2.1) (optional to avoid vim) git commit -m "message here"
        3) add comments, press esc, type ":wq"
        4) git push
    
    To get a working copy of new code on the master branch onto your branch:
        1) git checkout <your branch>
        2) git merge master
        3) git push

RASPBERRY PI:
    Raspberry Pi Hardware:
        1) We are using BCM pinout. Please ensure all pin numbers adhere to this convention.
    
    Raspberry Pi Quick Tips:
        SSHing into the Raspberry Pi:
            Find the IP addess of the Rasp Pi.
            Use Putty to SSH.
        Methods of transferring files into the Rasp Pi:
            Git: git pull the repository into the working directory. (Requires internet access)
            SFTP: Use Filezilla to SFTP into the working directory. (Requires the Rasp Pi to be on the same LAN, or port forwarded if access required over the internet.)
            Dumb but foolproof if all else fails: Thumbdrive

LINUX COMMANDS:
    Quick tip: hit the tab button to autofill.

    Directory format: 
        /home/pi is an absolute directory, i.e. from '/', go into the 'home' folder, then go into the 'pi' folder
        however, if you want to enter a directory within your current working directory, omit the '/'.
        e.g.    pwd
                >>> /home/pi
                cd Desktop
                pwd
                >>> /home/pi/Desktop
    
    sudo                    --- super user do. A prefix to give administrator(root) rights to do an action. e.g. 'sudo nano' means open a nano instance with admin rights
    pwd                     --- see current working directory
    cd <directory>          --- enter a directory
    cd ..                   --- up one level
    ls                      --- list all files and folders in the current working directory
    nano <filename>         --- open the nano text editor
    chmod +x <filename>     --- change the file permissions to executable.
    ./<filename>            --- run an executable file in the bash terminal. Use hashbang (#!/usr/bin/env python) to run python files.
    python <filename>       --- run python file
